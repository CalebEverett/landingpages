    <h3>Why is Accreditation Important?</h3>
    <p>Accreditation is the process of evaluating a school or educational training program to determine whether it meets standards set up by an accrediting organization. When you attend an accredited institution, you are attending a school that has undergone a rigorous process that evaluates educational quality. It’s not easy to become or remain an accredited institution. The rules and regulations are strict, precise and designed to protect students.</p>
